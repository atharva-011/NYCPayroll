    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe topic that we are working on is New York City Payroll Data Analysis. Payroll data provides insights into workforce dynamics, and demographic patterns of municipal employees of New York City. We aim to identify trends and patterns in the payroll of New York municipal employees for last 10 years (2014 - 2023). There are few topics that we think are important to study in order to understand the trends.\nGeographic Influence on Base Salaries:\nHow does the geographic work location (borough) in New York City influence the base salaries of employees?\nWork Experience, Payroll, and Borough Connections:\nIs there any connections between an individual’s amount of work experience, payroll, and the specific borough where they are employed?\nJob Profile Impact on Payroll:\nDoes the job profile (Title Description) have an impact on the payroll? / Are certain type of jobs are borough specific?\nOvertime Work and Payroll Relationship:\nWhat is the relationship between overtime work and the payroll?\nLeave Status and Workforce Dynamics:\nExamining the leave status of employees.\nAdditionally, we can study financial resources allocation and how much resources are devoted to overtime. Examining the impact of job profiles on payroll and identifying any borough-specific jobs will offer a deeper understanding of the payroll dynamics. Furthermore, the analysis into the relationship between overtime work and payroll aims to uncover insights into work culture and potential areas for improvement in work-life balance and the payroll itself(underpaid / overpaid).\nBy addressing above mentioned questions, through exploratory data analysis and visualisation we can gain insights to form more inclusive and fair policies aimed at bridging income gaps, a better and inclusive job market, and guiding initiatives related to education, upskilling, and training to even out the disparity."

    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\n2.1 Technical description The data that we plan on using for Payroll Analysis is from NYC Open Data website and is titled as Citywide Payroll Data (Fiscal Year) . The data set was created back in 2015 and has been constantly been updated on a annual basis (last update was on November 28,2023). It tells us about the amount of money spent on salary and overtime pay for all municipal employees based in New York City. The data is provided by Office of Payroll Administration (OPA).\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(httr)\nlibrary(jsonlite)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\n\nHere is the link to the dataset: “https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e”\nThe data consists of 5.66 million rows (essentially 5.66 million municipal employees) and 17 columns. Every row basically tells us about the employee salary, their work location, agency, base pay, overtime (if any), etc.\nHere are the columns of the dataset:\n\n\nCode\ndata_url &lt;- \"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/k397-673e.json\"\n\nresponse &lt;- httr::GET(url = data_url)\ndata &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(content(response, \"text\", encoding = \"UTF-8\"))\n\n# Display columns of the dataset\n\ncat(\"Columns of the dataset:\\n\")\n\n\nColumns of the dataset:\n\n\nCode\nkable(data.frame(Column_Names = names(data)), \"markdown\")\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn_Names\n\n\n\n\nfiscal_year\n\n\npayroll_number\n\n\nagency_name\n\n\nlast_name\n\n\nfirst_name\n\n\nmid_init\n\n\nagency_start_date\n\n\nwork_location_borough\n\n\ntitle_description\n\n\nleave_status_as_of_june_30\n\n\nbase_salary\n\n\npay_basis\n\n\nregular_hours\n\n\nregular_gross_paid\n\n\not_hours\n\n\ntotal_ot_paid\n\n\ntotal_other_pay\n\n\n\n\n\nOn further studying the data thoroughly, we find that there are few inconsistencies in the data such that for few employees the salaries are not per annum but are per day/hour so we need to perform certain operation to ensure that all salaries are per annum."
