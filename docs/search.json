    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe topic that we are working on is New York City Payroll Data Analysis. Payroll data provides insights into workforce dynamics, and demographic patterns of municipal employees of New York City. We aim to identify trends and patterns in the payroll of New York municipal employees for last 10 years (2014 - 2023). There are few topics that we think are important to study in order to understand the trends.\n\nEmployee Compensation Distribution:\n\nExamine the distribution of the total compensation of all the employees, and try to see gain insights on how salaries are distributed.\n\nInfluence of Geographic Location and Agency on Budget Allocation:\n\nHow does the geographic work location (borough) in New York City, along with the agency, influence the budget allocation?\n\nWork Experience, Payroll, and Borough Connections:\n\nIs there any connections between an individual’s amount of work experience, payroll, and the specific borough where they are employed?\n\nJob Profile & Team Impact on Payroll:\n\nDoes the job profile (Title Description) have an impact on the payroll? / Are certain type of jobs are agency specific? How do the salaries vary?\n\nOvertime Work and Payroll Relationship Over Time:\n\nHow has the relationship between overtime work and the payroll evolvd over time?\n\nLeave Status and Workforce Dynamics:\n\nExamining the leave status of employees.\n\nExamining the Distribution of the Breakdown of the Salaries”\n\nHow are the various components of the total pay distributed?\nAdditionally, we can study financial resources allocation and how much resources are devoted to overtime. Examining the impact of job profiles on payroll and identifying any borough-specific jobs will offer a deeper understanding of the payroll dynamics. Furthermore, the analysis into the relationship between overtime work and payroll aims to uncover insights into work culture and potential areas for improvement in work-life balance and the payroll itself(underpaid / overpaid).\nBy addressing above mentioned questions, through exploratory data analysis and visualization we can gain insights to form more inclusive and fair policies aimed at bridging income gaps, a better and inclusive job market, and guiding initiatives related to education, up-skilling, and training to even out the disparity, if any."

This feature represents the middle initial of the person under consideration.\n\n\nCode\nplot_missing(nyc_payroll_data, percent = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\nAs can be seen from the above plot, there are only two patterns which can be observed in our data. The first being the complete lack of NaN values, whereas the second pattern exhibits missing values in one column only, namely, mid_init.\nThe graph on the right shows that there are nearly 300 rows exhibiting the second pattern, and about 700 points exhibiting the first, where they do not have any missing values at all.\nWe also get to see which columns have missing values in the form of a bar chart on top, and see that only one column falls under this category.\n\n\nCode\nmissing_data.frame(nyc_payroll_data) |&gt; image()\n\n\nWarning in .local(.Object, ...): Last Name : some observations changing to NA\n\n\nWarning in .local(.Object, ...): First Name : some observations changing to NA\n\n\nWarning in .local(.Object, ...): Mid Init : some observations changing to NA\n\n\nWarning in .local(.Object, ...): Agency Start Date : some observations changing\nto NA\n\n\nWarning in .local(.Object, ...): Work Location Borough : some observations\nchanging to NA\n\n\nNOTE: The following pairs of variables appear to have the same missingness pattern.\n Please verify whether they are in fact logically distinct variables.\n     [,1]        [,2]        \n[1,] \"Last Name\" \"First Name\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows us the missing values in the entire dataset. The cells represent the actual values after scaling, defined by each row and column of the actual dataset. Higher values take on the lighter colors, whereas colors close to red represent values closer to -1.\nThe values in black, indicate missing data. Here, we see that mid_init has missing data for nearly 300 hundred contiguous rows.\nAlthough the absolute reason for the same is unknown, it could be possible that this data was not collected at all in that period. This can be inferred from the pattern."
