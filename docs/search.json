Payroll data provides insights into workforce dynamics, and demographic patterns of municipal employees of New York City. We aim to identify trends and patterns in the payroll of New York municipal employees for last 10 years (2014 - 2023). There are few topics that we think are important to study in order to understand the trends.\nGeographic Influence on Base Salaries:\nHow does the geographic work location (borough) in New York City influence the base salaries of employees?\nWork Experience, Payroll, and Borough Connections:\nIs there any connections between an individual’s amount of work experience, payroll, and the specific borough where they are employed?\nJob Profile Impact on Payroll:\nDoes the job profile (Title Description) have an impact on the payroll? / Are certain type of jobs are borough specific?\nOvertime Work and Payroll Relationship:\nWhat is the relationship between overtime work and the payroll?\nLeave Status and Workforce Dynamics:\nExamining the leave status of employees.\nAdditionally, we can study financial resources allocation and how much resources are devoted to overtime. Examining the impact of job profiles on payroll and identifying any borough-specific jobs will offer a deeper understanding of the payroll dynamics. Furthermore, the analysis into the relationship between overtime work and payroll aims to uncover insights into work culture and potential areas for improvement in work-life balance and the payroll itself(underpaid / overpaid).\nBy addressing above mentioned questions, through exploratory data analysis and visualisation we can gain insights to form more inclusive and fair policies aimed at bridging income gaps, a better and inclusive job market, and guiding initiatives related to education, upskilling, and training to even out the disparity."
