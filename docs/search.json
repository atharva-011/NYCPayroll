    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe topic that we are working on is New York City Payroll Data Analysis. Payroll data provides insights into workforce dynamics, and demographic patterns of municipal employees of New York City. We aim to identify trends and patterns in the payroll of New York municipal employees for last 10 years (2014 - 2023). There are few topics that we think are important to study in order to understand the trends.\nGeographic Influence on Base Salaries:\nHow does the geographic work location (borough) in New York City influence the base salaries of employees?\nWork Experience, Payroll, and Borough Connections:\nIs there any connections between an individual’s amount of work experience, payroll, and the specific borough where they are employed?\nJob Profile Impact on Payroll:\nDoes the job profile (Title Description) have an impact on the payroll? / Are certain type of jobs are borough specific?\nOvertime Work and Payroll Relationship:\nWhat is the relationship between overtime work and the payroll?\nLeave Status and Workforce Dynamics:\nExamining the leave status of employees.\nAdditionally, we can study financial resources allocation and how much resources are devoted to overtime. Examining the impact of job profiles on payroll and identifying any borough-specific jobs will offer a deeper understanding of the payroll dynamics. Furthermore, the analysis into the relationship between overtime work and payroll aims to uncover insights into work culture and potential areas for improvement in work-life balance and the payroll itself(underpaid / overpaid).\nBy addressing above mentioned questions, through exploratory data analysis and visualisation we can gain insights to form more inclusive and fair policies aimed at bridging income gaps, a better and inclusive job market, and guiding initiatives related to education, upskilling, and training to even out the disparity."

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\n2.1 Technical description\nIdentify one or more data sources (see II. D. above) that you propose to draw on for the project. For each, describe how the data are collected and by whom. Describe the format of the data, the frequency of updates, dimensions, and any other relevant information. Note any issues / problems with the data, either known or that you discover. Explain how you plan to import the data. Carefully document your sources with links to the precise data sources that you used. If that is not possible (for example if your data is not available online, then explain that clearly.) (suggested: 1 page)\nThe data that we plan on using for Payroll Analysis is from NYC Open Data website and is titled as Citywide Payroll Data (Fiscal Year) . The data set was created back in 2015 and has been constantly been updated on a annual basis (last update was on November 28,2023). It tells us about the amount of money spent on salary and overtime pay for all municipal employees based in New York City. The data is provided by Office of Payroll Administration (OPA). Here is the link to dataset: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e\nThe data consists of 5.66 million rows (essentially 5.66 million municipal employees) and 17 columns. Every row basically tells us about the employee salary, their work location, agency, base pay, overtime (if any), etc.\nHere are the columns of the dataset:\n\n\nCode\n# Install and load necessary packages (if not already installed)\n# install.packages(\"httr\")\n# install.packages(\"jsonlite\")\nlibrary(httr)\nlibrary(jsonlite)\n\n# URL of the dataset\ndata_url &lt;- \"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/k397-673e.json\"\n\n# Make a GET request to the API endpoint and parse the JSON response\nresponse &lt;- httr::GET(url = data_url)\ndata &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(content(response, \"text\", encoding = \"UTF-8\"))\n\n# Display columns of the dataset\ncat(\"Columns of the dataset:\\n\")\n\n\nColumns of the dataset:\n\n\nCode\nprint(names(data))\n\n\n [1] \"fiscal_year\"                \"payroll_number\"            \n [3] \"agency_name\"                \"last_name\"                 \n [5] \"first_name\"                 \"agency_start_date\"         \n [7] \"work_location_borough\"      \"title_description\"         \n [9] \"leave_status_as_of_june_30\" \"base_salary\"               \n[11] \"pay_basis\"                  \"regular_hours\"             \n[13] \"regular_gross_paid\"         \"ot_hours\"                  \n[15] \"total_ot_paid\"              \"total_other_pay\"           \n[17] \"mid_init\"                  \n\n\n2.2 Research plan\nExplain in detail how your data will enable you to answer your research questions from the introduction.\n(suggested: 1 page)\n2.3 Missing value analysis\nDescribe any patterns you discover in missing values. If no values are missing, graphs should still be included showing that.\n(suggested: 2 graphs plus commentary)\nfew salaries are not per annum (per day/hour)"
